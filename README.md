# internet-speed
Masure the upload and download speed of my home internet.

Recently I moved to a new place. I contracted an internet service provider. To my surprise they didn't deliver the internet speed I'm paying for.
I contacted them and they solved it. Nonetheless the next day they dropped my bandwidth again.
The idea of this repository is to have a script that allows me to check my down and up speed and log it to a txt file.
With this information at hand, if the internet provider business does not fulfill its responsibility, I have proof to make them accountable :).

Finally, I'm grateful to #openAI #chatGPT tool which allowed me to quickly develop this script :)
